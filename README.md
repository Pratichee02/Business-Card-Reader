Business Card Data Extraction Project
Aim
The Business Card Data Extraction project is designed to automate the process of extracting relevant information from business cards using a combination of Python-based machine learning techniques, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP). The primary goal is to streamline the tedious task of manually entering contact details by developing an efficient and accurate system that can recognize and extract essential information from business cards.

Technologies Used
Python: The core of the project utilizes Python for its versatility and extensive libraries. Machine learning, computer vision, and NLP modules are implemented to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction.

Machine Learning: Leveraging machine learning algorithms to train the system for recognizing various formats and layouts of business cards. This allows the system to adapt and improve its accuracy over time.

Computer Vision: Utilizing computer vision techniques to analyze and interpret the visual components of business cards. Image processing algorithms are employed to identify text, logos, and other relevant elements.
Tools: Open CV, Tesseract OCR

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implementing NLP techniques to understand and extract meaningful information from the text on business cards. This includes the identification of names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other key details.
Tools: Pandas, SpaCy, RegEx

HTML & CSS for Web Interface: Creating a user-friendly web interface using HTML and CSS to allow users to easily upload images of business cards. The interface provides a seamless experience for interacting with the system and retrieving extracted data.

Project Type
This project is categorized as a Full Stack application as it involves both frontend and backend components. The frontend includes the user interface implemented with HTML and CSS, while the backend is powered by Python for data extraction using machine learning, computer vision, and NLP techniques.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images of business cards through the web interface.
Data Extraction: The system employs machine learning, computer vision, and NLP to accurately extract relevant information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and job titles from business cards.
User-Friendly Interface: The HTML and CSS-based web interface ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.
Adaptive Learning: The system continually improves its accuracy over time through machine learning, adapting to various business card formats and layouts.
